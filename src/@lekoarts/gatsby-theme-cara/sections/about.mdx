## About

My name is Prathamesh Mali, I like tech and anything related to Computers. I also like to build software and websites. I'm a logical thinker and good problem solver. I am very passionate about writing clean code and solving business problems.

In 2019 I've completed BSc Computer Science. Now I'm doing MSc Computer Science. I am going to specialize in Cloud computing. Right now I'm learning Java and web development.

Apart from coding I like to Workout, play video games and watch TV series.
